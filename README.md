US Traffic Accidents Data Analysis : An overview of data sources, analysis techniques and contributing factors

Overview:

Road traffic accidents have become one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities in the world. Road traffic crashes rank as the 9th leading cause of death and accounts for 2.2% of all deaths globally. Road crashes cost USD 518 billion globally, costing individual countries from 1 to 2% of their annual GDP. In the USA, over 37,000 people die in road crashes each year with 2.25 million injury and disability which cost the US $230.6 billion per year.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge. Hence, it represents an important field of research towards the use of traffic accident analysis and prediction techniques to determine the most key factors contributing to road traffic accidents. 

Objective:

This project aims to provide an overview of road accident data sources, data analysis techniques and various algorithms used to build road accident forecasts.

Details of the Data:

US Accidents currently contains data of about 2.25 million instances of traffic accidents collected from February 2016 to March 2019 which covers 49 states in the United States. Each accident record consists of a variety of intrinsic and contextual attributes such as location, time, weather, period of the day, and points of interest.

The dataset can be found in Kaggle with the link: US Traffic Accidents

Method of Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) would be used as the primary method to analyze and investigate the data sets and summarize its main characteristics, employing data visualization methods. EDA can help identify errors, better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, test hypotheses, or check assumptions, and find interesting relations among the variables.
Data Scientists often use exploratory data analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can be used for more sophisticated data analysis or modeling.
